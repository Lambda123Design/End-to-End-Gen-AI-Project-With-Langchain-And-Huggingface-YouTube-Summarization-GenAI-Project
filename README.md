# End-to-End-Gen-AI-Project-With-Langchain-And-Huggingface-YouTube-Summarization-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files on "End to End Gen AI Project With Langchain And Huggingface - YouTube Summarization", an GenAI Project

(i) Developed an end-to-end text summarization application using LangChain integrated with Hugging Face Endpoint models

(ii) Built a Streamlit interface to input Hugging Face API token and provide URLs from YouTube or any website for content summarization.

(iii) Implemented HuggingFaceEndpoint for model integration, supporting text-generation tasks using models like Mistral.

(iv) Created a summarization function to extract content from URLs and generate concise summaries, maintaining a modular and reusable code structure.

(v) Enabled easy extension for advanced use cases, including Hugging Face embeddings for vector-based tasks, RAG pipelines, and Q&A applications.

(vi) Delivered a fully functional, scalable, and user-friendly app that demonstrates Hugging Face model integration with LangChain for real-world content summarization.
